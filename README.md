## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alnroy/cardio.git
cd cardio
2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

3️⃣ Install dependencies

pip install django flask numpy pandas scikit-learn

4️⃣ Run the application

For Django:

python manage.py runserver

🧠 Model Overview

The model uses a supervised learning algorithm trained on patient health data including:

Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type

Blood Pressure, Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results

Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina

The output is a binary classification:

1 — Heart Disease Present
0 — No Heart Disease Detected
🧰 Requirements

Make sure you have installed:

Python 3.8+

pip (Python package manager)

Git
